    //The code segment below is intended to randomly print one of the values 2, 4, 6, or 8 with equal probability.

    //int val = /* missing code temp replacement*/
    //val *= 2;
    //System.out.print(val);
//Which of the following can be used to replace /* missing code */ so that the code segment works as intended?
//int a = (Math.random() * 4 + 1);
//int b = (Math.random() * 8); 
int c = (int) (Math.random() * 4);
int d = (int) (Math.random() * 4 + 1); 
int e = (int) (Math.random() * 8 + 1);

//A and B give lousy conversion errors, so cannot be correct. 
//Math.random() returns a double between 0 and 1. Multiplying by 4 and adding 1 gives the available set at 1234
//By multiplying 1234 by 2 you get 2468 as the possible options for answers.
